            <br />
            <br /> I have found out that absolutely nothing prepares you for the
            disability of your child. Even though some parents have the
            ‘opportunity’ of knowing about their children’s condition during
            pregnancy, the reality of ‘life as a Carer’ still pales until you
            begin to live it!
            <br />
            <br /> In my situation, we had no idea we would be going on this
            route until after 18 months of nurturing a healthy child!

            <h2>THE CHURCH</h2>
            <p>
              The Church’s response to the issues of disabilities varies widely
              depending on diverse factors ranging but not limited to church
              denomination; attitude; knowledge; exposure; social; geographical;
              cultural, and several other related factors. While some
              erroneously believe disability is a “result of someone’s sins” or
              God trying to ‘punish’ an individual or the family; some others
              believe God must heal every disability and the person with
              disability should have ‘faith’, just to mention a few.
