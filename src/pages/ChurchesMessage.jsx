            The Lord Jesus directly mandated the Church in Luke 14:21-23 as a
            matter of urgency saying: "...Then the owner of the house became
            angry and said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and
            alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind,
            and the lame.' So, the master told his servant, 'Go out to the
            highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house
            will be full..."

            <br /> Only the gospel of Jesus can make a lasting, significant, and
            eternal difference in the lives of people with disabilities; just
            like it is for every living being on the surface of the earth! The
            needs of families dealing with disabilities go beyond charitable
            offers, as helpful as these are.

          <li>
            Over one billion people, or 15% of the world’s population, live with
            some form of disability, and of these, between 110 and 190 million
            have significant difficulties in functioning, according to the World
            Report on Disability
          </li>
          <li>
            Only 5 to 10% of the world’s disabled are effectively reached with
            the gospel, making the disability community one of the largest
            unreached — some say under-reached — or hidden people groups in the
            world
          </li>
          <li>
            “90% – 95% of the world’s disabled people never hear the Gospel”
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a higher possibility of divorce or separation among
            families that are affected by disabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            More than 90% of church-going special needs parents cited the most
            helpful support to be a “welcoming attitude toward people with
            disabilities.”
